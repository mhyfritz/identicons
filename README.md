# GitHub-style identicons

- DIY -- draw it yourself
- random generator
- string digest (custom algorithm, i.e. different from GitHub's)

## Running the app
* online at http://mhyfritz.com/identicons/
* or clone and open `dist/index.html`

NOTE: the color picker is an `<input>` element of type `color`,
which is not widely supported at the moment (http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color).
Chrome is your best bet.
